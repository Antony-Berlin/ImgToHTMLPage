# Project Name: HTML Image Renderer

## Overview

The HTML Image Renderer is a web application that takes an image as input and converts it into HTML code, rendering the HTML representation of the image in real-time. The application allows users to upload an image, process it, and display the corresponding HTML code and rendered output in a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- Upload Image: Users can upload an image from their local system using the "Upload Image" button.
- Image Processing: The uploaded image is processed using advanced image recognition techniques to extract the handwritten or typed text content.
- HTML Conversion: The recognized text content is converted into valid HTML code, replicating the image's content structure.
- Real-time Rendering: The generated HTML code is instantly rendered and displayed in the "HTML Render" section of the application.
- User-Friendly Interface: The application offers a simple and intuitive user interface, making it easy for users to interact with the tool.
- Efficiency: The image processing and HTML conversion are optimized to ensure quick results even for large images.
